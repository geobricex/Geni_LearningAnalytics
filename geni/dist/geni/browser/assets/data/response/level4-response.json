        "by_student": "Each student in the report displays varying levels of engagement. Jeniffer López Aguiar shows increased engagement with frequent logins and extended time on the platform, leading to improved grades. Luis Rosado Angueta has a stable grade trend but has reduced his engagement over the last week, suggesting potential issues. Nara Boza Arzube maintains a stable high-grade trend with excellent participation. Meanwhile, Juan Carlos Caviedes has declining grades and engagement, missing multiple activities and having minimal platform interaction.",
        "performance_statistics": "Overall engagement trends highlight an average recent grade of 7.78 with significant variability (standard deviation of 1.75). The most common grade is 5.8, with a grade range from 5.8 to 9.7. There are two students with stable grades, one with improving, and one with declining performance. Engagement changes show a mix of stability, increase, and decrease across the students, and average connection time is approximately 47.15 minutes per session. Despite these varied trends, the average participation slope is negative, indicating a general engagement decline.",
        "average_by_activity_type": "When analyzing engagement by activity types, students show the highest engagement levels with quizzes (average score 8.12), followed by forums (7.88), and then assignments (tarea) with an average of 7.48. This suggests that students are most engaged and perhaps more comfortable with quiz-based activities, which might require less extended interaction compared to forums and assignments.",
        "top_3_students": "The top three students by engagement are Nara Boza Arzube, Jeniffer López Aguiar, and Luis Rosado Angueta. Nara Boza Arzube stands out with the highest grades and consistent engagement patterns, missing no activities. Jeniffer has made significant improvements in both grades and engagement, highlighting a positive engagement change. Luis, although included in the top three, reflects about average engagement metrics compared to his peers, yet his participation slope is negative, indicating potential issues.",
        "students_below_average": "The students with engagement below average are Luis Rosado Angueta and Juan Carlos Caviedes. Juan Carlos shows the most concern as he has the lowest average grades with a downward trend and the least time spent and logged onto the platform. Luis also shows reduced engagement with average grades, suggesting that these students may be facing external challenges or disengagement from course activities.",
        "highest_participation": "Jeniffer López Aguiar and Nara Boza Arzube lead in highest participation. Their frequent engagement and consistent time on platform positively correlate with their academic performance, showing the importance of regular participation in academic success. Their active involvement could be driving their retention and understanding of course materials, reflected in their superior grades.",
        "lowest_participation": "Juan Carlos Caviedes has participated the least, with infrequent logins and a short duration of connection time. This lack of engagement suggests a potential struggle in maintaining consistent interaction with course content, likely affecting his grade trend negatively. It indicates a higher risk of falling further behind without intervention.",
        "students_at_risk": "Students marked as at risk due to low and declining engagement include Luis Rosado Angueta and Juan Carlos Caviedes. Their metrics show a worrying decrease in participation and time spent on the platform, coupled with missed assignments and unstable or decreasing grades, suggesting they are at risk of underperformance and potentially dropping out.",
        "prediction_results": "The predicted engagement outcomes suggest that while Luis Rosado Angueta might achieve a future grade of 7.92, current engagement patterns hint at potential challenges. The predictive model aims to provide a forecast that can be used to guide interventions and aid students in maintaining or improving their performance.",
        "risk_results": "Risk results identify Luis Rosado Angueta as 'Safe' based on predictions, yet the zero accuracy in risk predictions suggests that the model needs refinement or additional data inputs to better capture the complexities of student engagement and risk accurately.",
        "clusters": "The analysis of engagement clusters reveals three distinct groups. Cluster 0, with Luis Rosado Angueta and Juan Carlos Caviedes, has lower engagement and grades, highlighting students who may need more support. Cluster 1, containing Nara Boza Arzube, represents high achievers with strong engagement. Cluster 2, with Jeniffer López Aguiar, shows students improving or maintaining high engagement, suggesting a positive trajectory in academic involvement."
